renaissance in the Software Industry, and that is also true of the
Indian software industry. There are a lot of functional programming
enthusiasts and a lot of new jobs that prefer people with FP experience.
However there is a need for a concerted effort to connect the two
together. This site is intended to serve that purpose by providing an
India and FP focused job board.</p>
<p>We clearly divide our job posts into the level of FP experience
thatâ€™s desired. This does NOT reflect the seniority level of the job
itself. Often companies look for people in senior roles, whop may not
yet have significant experience with Functional Programming, but have
some demonstrable interest in it. This could mean writing blog posts,
having small FP projects on Github, participating in FP communities
(like this one!) and attending FP meetups. We especially welcome jobs
that involve working with <a
href="https://www.simplehaskell.org/">Simple Haskell</a> or other such
simple FP in other languages.</p>
<p>If you would like to post a job here, please email <a
href="mailto:jobboard@functionalprogramming.in">jobboard@functionalprogramming.in</a>
with the details. Job postings are completely free, but require that the
jobs involve actual functional programming (in any language or
platform). You can also mail us if you are looking for a job and would
like to be updated when we have jobs that suit your profile.</p></div><footer class="w-full h-10 bg-rose-300 rounded p-2 border-t-2 border-white fixed left-0 bottom-0 flex justify-center items-center text-white text-1xl"><pre class="text-black">Made with </pre><a class="text-red-500 hover" href="https://ema.srid.ca/">Ema</a></footer></div></body></html>
