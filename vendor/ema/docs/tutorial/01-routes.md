# Add Routes

A hello-world site is not very interesting. Let's write an application to track moods, i.e., a [mood tracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mood_tracking) app. We will record our moods in [plain-text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text) (a CSV file) and view them through an Ema app.

The first step is to think about the various pages and define their corresponding [[route|route]] types. Since our application will have an index page (displaying mood summary) and pages specific to the individual days, we will use an ADT with two constructors:

```haskell
data Route
  = Route_Index     -- /index.html
  | Route_Date Date -- /date/YYYY-MM-DD.html
  deriving stock (Show, Eq, Ord, Generic)

deriveGeneric ''Route
deriveIsRoute ''Route [t|'[]|]
```

We must derive `IsRoute` to enrich our route type with three capabilities:

1. `RouteModel`: associate a value type ([[model]]) that will be used for encoding and decoding routes (see next point)
2. `routePrism`: produce [[prism]] (a `Prism'`) that we can use to encode routes to URLs and vice versa. 
3. `routeUniverse`: generate a list of routes to statically generate

Here, we use TemplateHaskell to derive `IsRoute` *generically*, instead of hand-writing the instance. We can of course also derive `IsRoute` manually. In fact, we must do it for the `Date` sub-route type (because it is not an ADT, like `Route` above, shaped for [[generic]]):


```haskell
import Data.Time
import Optics.Core (prism')

-- | Isomorphic to `Data.Time.Calendar.Day`
newtype Date = Date (Integer, Int, Int)
  deriving stock
    (Show, Eq, Ord, Generic)

instance IsRoute Date where
  type RouteModel Date = ()
  routePrism () = Ema.toPrism_ $
    prism'
      ( \(Date (y, m, d)) ->
          formatTime defaultTimeLocale "%Y-%m-%d.html" $
            fromGregorian y m d
      )
      ( fmap (Date . toGregorian)
          . parseTimeM False defaultTimeLocale "%Y-%m-%d.html"
      )
  routeUniverse () = [] -- need model for this
```

1. We don't need any special [[model]] to encode a `Date` route, thus `RouteModel` is a unit. But we'll modify this in next step (to implement `routeUniverse`).
2. `toPrism_` is an Ema function that converts the optics-core `Prism'` into a coercible `Prism_` type that Ema internally uses. A route prism knows how to encode and decode the `Date` route. Our route `Prism'` is built using `formatTime` and `parseTimeM`.
3. We will implement `routeUniverse` in the next step of the tutorial

The result is that we can use the function `routeUrl` to get the URL to our routes. Let's see this in action in GHCi (run `bin/repl` in the template repository):

```haskell
ghci> -- First get hold of the route Prism, which is passed to `siteOutput`
ghci> let rp = fromPrism_ $ routePrism @Route ()
ghci> Ema.routeUrl rp Route_Index
"" -- The 'index.html' is dropped as it is redundant in HTML.
ghci> Ema.routeUrl rp $ Route_Date $ Date (2022, 04, 23)
"date/2022-04-23.html" 
```

You also can use [optics](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/optics-core) operators to directly operate on route prisms.

```haskell
-- NOTE: Using `rp` from GHCi session above
ghci> import Optics.Core
ghci> review rp Route_Index
"index.html"
ghci> preview rp "2022-04-23.html"
Nothing
ghci> preview rp "date/2022-04-23.html"
Just (Route_Date (Date (2022,4,23)))
```

See [[route]] for details.
