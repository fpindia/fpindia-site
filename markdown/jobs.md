## About the FPIndia Job Board

Functional Programming principles and practices are seeing a renaissance in the Software Industry, and that is also true of the Indian software industry. There are a lot of functional programming enthusiasts and a lot of new jobs that prefer people with FP experience. However there is a need for a concerted effort to connect the two together. This site is intended to serve that purpose by providing an India and FP focused job board.

We clearly divide our job posts into the level of FP experience that's desired. This does NOT reflect the seniority level of the job itself. Often companies look for people in senior roles, whop may not yet have significant experience with Functional Programming, but have some demonstrable interest in it. This could mean writing blog posts, having small FP projects on Github, participating in FP communities (like this one!) and attending FP meetups. We especially welcome jobs that involve working with [Simple Haskell](https://www.simplehaskell.org/) or other such simple FP in other languages.

If you would like to post a job here, please email jobboard@functionalprogramming.in with the details. Job postings are completely free, but require that the jobs involve actual functional programming (in any language or platform). You can also mail us if you are looking for a job and would like to be updated when we have jobs that suit your profile.
