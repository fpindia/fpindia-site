### FPIndia Advent Calendar January 2025 

[FPIndia Advent Calendar January 2025](advent/2025.html) is a month long event to share functional programming stories, experiences, and resources by the FPIndia community. The event is inspired by the [F# Advent Calendar](https://sergeytihon.com/2024/10/26/f-advent-calendar-in-english-2024/).

The rules are -

  - Choose a Functional Programming related topic for your blog post or youtube video and reserve the slot by messaging on [Telegram](https://t.me/fpncr), or [Twitter](https://x.com/functionalindia). Please note that you do not have to announce the topic until the date (but you can).
  - Prepare a blog post or video in English or any regional Indian language.
  - Publish your post on a specified date (according to the calendar).
  - Post the link to your post on Telegram or Twitter with hashtags #FpIndia and #FPIndiaAdvent.

### Effect Systems Reading Group (Remote)

[Effect Systems Reading Group](https://hasgeek.com/fpindia/effect-systems-reading-group/) was a reading group to discuss effect systems in functional programming languages.

Topics included - What is an “Effect System”? Why do they matter, what is the motivation and the theory behind them. How do you implement them in Functional Programming languages?

The online meetup took place once every two weeks on Saturdays. 

The [FPIndia Telegram group](https://t.me/fpncr) has a dedicated channel to discuss material related to this reading group. You can participate in the discussion there even if you miss the online meetup.

These meetups may be revived in the future if there's enough interest.

### Algorithm Design with Haskell Reading Group (Remote)

[Algorithms Meetup Group](https://hasgeek.com/fpindia/algorithm-design-with-haskell-reading-group/) was a reading group to discuss algorithms and data structure design in Haskell (and other functional programming languages).

Topics included - What are the principles of designing pure functional algorithms? How do we implement them, and optimise them. Theoretical as well as practical concerns.

The meetups started by by going through the “Algorithm Design with Haskell” book by Richard Bird and Jeremy Gibbons. And the online meetups took place once every two weeks on Saturdays.

The [FPIndia Telegram group](https://t.me/fpncr) has a dedicated channel called “Algorithms Meetup” to discuss material related to this reading group. You can participate in the discussion there even if you miss the online meetup.
