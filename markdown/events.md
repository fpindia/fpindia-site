### Effect Systems Reading Group (Ongoing) (Remote)

A reading group to discuss effect systems in functional programming languages.

What is an “Effect System”? Why do they matter, what is the motivation and the theory behind them. How do you implement them in Functional Programming languages?

This is a reading / study group to discuss these topics, and more.

The online meetup shall take place once every two weeks on Saturdays. The link to join shall be shared on the [Effect Systems Meetup HasGeek Page](https://hasgeek.com/fpindia/effect-systems-reading-group/).

The FPIndia Telegram group has a dedicated channel to discuss material related to this reading group. You can participate in the discussion there even if you miss the online meetup.

### Algorithm Design with Haskell Reading Group (Ongoing) (Remote)

A reading group to discuss algorithms and data structure design in Haskell (and other functional programming languages).

What are the principles of designing pure functional algorithms? How do we implement them, and optimise them. We’ll discuss theoretical as well as practical concerns.

To start with, we’ll be going through the “Algorithm Design with Haskell” book by Richard Bird and Jeremy Gibbons.

The online meetup shall take place once every two weeks on Saturdays. The link to join shall be shared on the [Algorithms Meetup HasGeek Page](https://hasgeek.com/fpindia/algorithm-design-with-haskell-reading-group/).

The FPIndia Telegram group has a dedicated channel called “Algorithms Meetup” to discuss material related to this reading group. You can participate in the discussion there even if you miss the online meetup.

### TechTriveni 2.0 (In-person)

In 2019, FPIndia was a community partner with **Tech Triveni 2.0** - Asia's first Functional & Reactive programming and big data conference. It was a unique experience for developers, data scientists, decision-makers and enthusiasts & experts from IT to collaborate on the latest architectures for building and running reactive, big data and functional systems that are scalable, high on performance using the reactive stack. Attendees to TechTriveni 2019 learnt about the latest advances in reactive and functional programming, microservices, streaming data, big data as well as real-world enterprise best practices.

RustyMonad was a Rust and FP focused event organised in collaboration with Mozilla in 2020. It was an opportunity to learn some cool technologies, network with like-minded people, and learn more about volunteering opportunities within the community. This event was cancelled due to the Covid pandemic, but may be revived if there's sufficient interest.
