The primary gathering place is this [community website](http://functionalprogramming.in/). However, we also have our members on these other platforms. We are active in our [Telegram Group](https://t.me/fpncr). Please join that group for informal discussions. It's a welcoming space for folks new to Functional Programming. There's also a nascent [Discord group](https://discord.com/invite/Ez3MU6W). Follow us on [FPIndia Twitter Account](https://twitter.com/functionalIndia). We upload meetup videos on the [FPIndia Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiySROube0vutFBu0M7pvxg) Finally you can always mail us at team@functionalprogramming.in for any help or questions.
