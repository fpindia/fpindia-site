## Ways to get involved

The primary gathering place is this [community website](http://functionalprogramming.in/). Content on this site should be taken as the source of truth for information on our activities.

We have the following two options for real time conversations with community members. Both are appropriate for informal discussions, and are welcoming spaces for folks new to Functional Programming.

1. Most conversations currently take place on the [Telegram Group](https://t.me/fpncr).
2. We have a nascent [Discord group](https://discord.com/invite/Ez3MU6W) which doesn't have as much going on at the present, but it does have the advantage of having channels, so you can choose only to read specific categories. This is also the place to discuss #offtopic stuff. You might also want to join the Discord group for discussions regarding ongoing Functional Programming courses.

Apart from that, you can engage with the community in the following ways -

1. Follow us on our [Twitter Account](https://twitter.com/functionalIndia)
2. We upload event videos on our [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiySROube0vutFBu0M7pvxg).
3. If you would like to help out with FPIndia development activities, head over to our [Github](https://github.com/fpindia). This is a great way to contribute to the community and to get some real world functional programming practice!

Finally, if you would like to reach out to the site admins directly for any reason, you can always mail us at [team@functionalprogramming.in](team@functionalprogramming.in).
